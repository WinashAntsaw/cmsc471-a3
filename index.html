        <p>
            The following visualization shows the Pollution per capita of three major countries (USA, UK, and France), to demonstrate the differences in pollution between each 
            country and across time. We can see the changes in pollution levels over the years as policies and industries change, as well as see clear differences in how each 
            country’s level of pollution. We made some specific design decisions as we were creating this visualization. For one, we initially wanted to look at total pollution 
            levels, but due to the drastic differences in population between some countries, it would’ve been more fair to adjust based on population for each. We also had to 
            make sure the scales we used were not misleading. Initially, we scaled it in such a way that it started at 0, but doing it in that way made it much more difficult 
            to see the changes over time, as those tended to be less pronounced than the differences between countries. It would be unfair to only say one country was creating 
            more pollution, and not be able to see whether or not they were attempting to actually improve their level of pollution. Thus the minimum value of the scale is 
            actually the minimum value within the data, not 0. We made sure to clearly label the Y-Axis so that this change would not be misleading. We also color coded each 
            country on a discrete color scale so that users could easily distinguish between countries, that way it was easy to see the change across years for even countries 
            that were similar in pollution levels

            <p>To create this black hat chart, we focused on average per-capita greenhouse gas emissions for the US, China, and India but never explicitly label it as “per capita.” 
                While the US does have higher per-person emissions, China’s total is much larger, with 12 million tons versus the US’s 4 million. 
                That difference is masked when divided by China’s massive population. India, with 2 million total but a far larger population, appears negligible on a per-capita basis, 
                reinforcing the illusion that the US is the worst offender. We also slightly truncate the y-axis to start at 1 instead of 0, exaggerating differences among the bars. 
                Cutting it further would magnify this gap even more, but we are limited by India’s already tiny bar. Another deceptive tactic is filtering out post-2016 data. 
                China and India’s observations end before 2016, while the US has downward-trending years after that. Ignoring these later points increases the US’s average. 
                Meanwhile, we aggregate “average emissions,” knowing the US has far more data points than India and China, further skewing comparisons. 
                By cherry-picking these three nations, we omit countries like Russia, Mexico, or Canada, whose populations and emissions might diminish the US’s apparent lead. 
                Finally, applying a color scale and coloring the US with a disproportionately red color visually amplifies its size. All together, omitting “per capita” from the chart (labeling), 
                truncating the y-axis and using a deceptive color scale (encoding), cutting off later data, and selecting just three countries (data transformation), 
                this creates an effective black hat visualization that falsely suggests the US is by far the world’s largest emitter.</p>
